ðŸ‘‹ This is the Chrome extension that I use to format my Github PRs.

To use it:
1. Clone this repo
2. Add a `secrets.json` at the root of the repo folder with your github API token:

```json
{
  "github_bearer_token": "{your github API token}"
}
```

3. Go to Chrome > Extensions > Manage Extensions > Load unpacked > Select the repo folder

Feel free to fork it if you want to make it your own but you'll lose track of possible updates.

I'm not opening collaboration just yet cause this is super tailored to my needs and I'm not sure I want to invest time into reviewing improvement propositions and all.
